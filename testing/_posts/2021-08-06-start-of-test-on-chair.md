This little project of blogging about testing in swift is fully inspired by [Google's testing on the toilet](https://testing.googleblog.com/search/label/TotT?updated-max=2008-06-26T09:43:00-07:00&max-results=20&start=58&by-date=false).
Testing gives your the confident when refactoring or adds new features. And it helps you design better code.

Since testing is so import, why not we share the expirence to different languages. After all the books and articles your have read about testing, you might need some more inpriation, tips, and prodding. 

Feel free to print those articles and post them up in your own bathrooms, hallways, kitchens, moon bases, secret underground fortresses, billionaire founders' Priuses, wherever.
